## The title is on, "A Review on Genotyping for Model organisms" 

### 01. Summary points from a paper titled; "Overview of Genotyping Technologies and Methods" by Kockum et al. 
### Link/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/cpz1.727

#### Key points; 
- The paper discusses the 4 commonly used genotyping methods. These include; 
  - Taqman genotyping
  - Pyrosequencing 
  - Microarray genotyping 
  - Next generation sequencing 
- Model organisms commonly used include; mice, rats, flies, fish, and worms. 
- Criteria to select these models consider consider similarities in genetics, anatomy, and physiology of the disease related factors. 
- A combination of alleles inherited from both parents, determine an individual's genotype 
- Genotyping is the process of determining the DNA sequence at a specific position in the genome 
- Actual genotyping post mendelian era was pioneered by the introduction of DNA sequencing back in 1970s, enabling the development of genotyping
- More into genotyping tools; 
   - Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), were used for genotyping between 1970s and 1980s 
      - limitations; labor intensive and time consuming 
   - Introducting PCR (1985), enabling DNA amplification of unlimited copies 
   - Introducing Microarrays, enabling querying multiple variants at a go
   - Introducing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), regarded as the highest resolution of genotpying due to the ability to determine the entire DNA sequence of a genome in single experiment 
   - Then, the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) 
- Criteria to choose a technology for genotyping; 
   - Parameters include;
      - amount (number of genetic markers) 
      - type/precision of genetic information needed 
      - size of the study cohort (number of individuals) 
      - computational capacity 
      - financial limitations 
   - To select the most effective and resource effecient genotyping method, one must first define the scope of the study (local or genome-wide), the level of detail wanted (grouping variable or DNA sequence), and then identify the technique that provides the appropriate information based on the available resources (personnel hours, equipment, money, and skill) 
- NGS based genotyping method has advantage over the other methods due to the ability to identify novel polymorphisms/mutations

### NB; With the above summary, how do I get to reduce this to a minimum of 4 lines. This should also apply to the rest of the papers following after this. 

#### The 4 lines summary; (Include title and link to the paper) 
- Genetic Variants 
  - Polymorphisms are genetic variations present in at least 1% of a population, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions or deletions (Indels), and larger copy number variations (CNVs). Some polymorphisms, like variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) and microsatellites, involve repeating DNA sequences that can influence traits or disease susceptibility. Among these, SNPs are the most well-studied due to their simplicity and widespread occurrence in the genome.
- Experimental models 
  - Human studies on traits and diseases face challenges due to population heterogeneity, ethical concerns, and limited access to relevant tissues. To overcome these limitations, researchers use model organisms like mice, rats, and fish, as their genomes (i.e similarities in genetics, anatomy nd physiology of the disease related-factors) share significant similarities with humans. These models allow controlled experiments to study genetic variations and disease mechanisms. Advances in genome editing, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, have enhanced the ability to modify genes accurately and efficiently. Findings from model organisms must ultimately be validated in human studies to ensure their relevance.
- State of the art on the genotyping methods 
  - The four commonly used genotyping methods include TaqMan, Pyrosequencing, Microarray genotyping, and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). TaqMan genotyping uses fluorescence-labeled probes to detect specific SNP variants during PCR amplification. Pyrosequencing measures light emission during nucleotide incorporation to determine DNA sequences. Microarray genotyping relies on DNA spots on a solid surface, where fluorescence signals reveal SNP variations. NGS enables high-throughput sequencing by synthesizing DNA fragments in parallel, allowing comprehensive SNP detection through bioinformatics analysis.
- Criteria to select a method 
  - The choice of a genotyping method depends on factors such as the number of genetic markers, precision needed, sample size, data processing capabilities, and budget. Sequencing provides the most detailed genetic information but is costly, while PCR-based methods offer lower-resolution data at a lower cost. The selected method should balance coverage and detail based on the study's objectives. Additionally, genotyping plays a crucial role in personalized medicine by predicting disease prognosis and optimizing treatment strategies for better health outcomes.

### 02. Summary points from a paper titled, "Recommendations for Choosing the Genotyping Method and Best Practices for Quality Control in Crop Genome-Wide Association Studies" 
### Link/DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.00447

#### Key points: 
- Genotyping methods for GWAS application in crops 
  - Genotyping methods for GWAS include whole genome resequencing (WGR), reduced representation sequencing (RRS), and SNP arrays. WGR and RRS use next-generation sequencing to align reads to a reference genome and call SNPs, while SNP arrays rely on allele-specific probes to infer genotypes. The choice of method depends on study objectives, crop genomic features, scale, and cost considerations.
- Genotyping accuracy approaches 
  - Filtering SNPs by call rate is a key quality control step to remove inaccurate genotype calls, with standard thresholds typically set at ≥95–99%, though lower thresholds may be used for low-depth NGS genotyping.
  - Rare variants at SNP loci are often excluded due to potential genotyping errors and low statistical power, with QC procedures commonly applying minor allele frequency (MAF) filters of ≥1–5% or minor allele count (MAC) thresholds of 5–10 to ensure reliable GWAS results.
  - High individual missing data rates often indicate poor DNA quality, potentially biasing analyses, so filtering for SNP missingness should precede individual filtering to avoid unnecessary sample removal, with thresholds chosen based on data distribution to minimize bias, especially in binary trait studies.
